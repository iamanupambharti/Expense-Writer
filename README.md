# Expense Tracker - AI

A modern, offline-first, AI-powered expense tracking application built with React and Tailwind CSS. This single-page application helps you track your expenses with ease, leveraging the power of Gemini for smart expense entry and analysis.

## ✨ Features

*   **📊 Expense Tracking:** Easily add, delete, and view your expenses. Each expense includes a name, amount, date, and location.
*   **🤖 AI-Powered Smart Add:**
    *   Simply type or speak in natural language (e.g., "Lunch at McDonald's for 12 dollars today").
    *   The app uses the Gemini API to understand your input, extract the details, and add the expense for you.
*   **🧠 AI-Powered Insights:**
    *   Get an AI-generated analysis of your spending habits.
    *   The analysis provides a summary, categorizes your expenses, and offers a helpful tip.

*   **🧾 Export to Excel:** Download your expense data as an `.xlsx` file for your records or further analysis.
*   **⚙️ Customizable:**
    *   **Locations:** Add and manage your own expense locations (e.g., Home, Office, Online).
    *   **Currency:** Choose from a variety of currency symbols (`$`, `€`, `£`, `₹`, `¥`).
